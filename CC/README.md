Chasing Cars
============

Files
-----

- `./run_falcaun_CC1-3.sh`: Script to falsify CC1, CC2, and CC3.
- `Makefile`: Makefile to generate the documents for this script.

Usage
-----

To run the benchmark, execute the scripts above. For each script, a document can be generated by [ROBODoc](https://rfsber.home.xs4all.nl/Robo/index.html). An example is as follows.

```sh
make doc
```

Remarks for FalCAuN
-------------------

- We used signal step = 10.0. It did not work with signal step = 5.0 due to stack overflow. This is because the nest of the next operator becomes too deep for LTSMin.
- The interval in the `.stl` file is the 1/10 of the original because the signal step is 10.0.
- Therefore, we cannot falsify CC4 and CC5.
