This repository contains the materials to execute [FalCAuN](https://github.com/MasWag/FalCAuN) with the benchmark for ARCH-COMP's [falsification](https://easychair.org/publications/paper/ps5t) track.

On the benchmarks
-----------------

FalCAuN can handle the following benchmarks

- AT
    - AT1
    - AT2
    - AT6{a,b,c}
        - For AT6{a,b}, although FalCAuN can handle "input Case 1", FalCAuN cannot handle "input Case 2" because the control points of the input and the observation point of the outputs must be the same.
- CC
    - CC1
    - CC2
    - CC3
    - (The input signals generated by FalCAuN are with control points for each 10 second, which is more strict than "input Case 2")
- SC
    - Although FalCAuN can handle "input Case 1", FalCAuN cannot handle "input Case 2" because the control points of the input and the observation point of the outputs must be the same.
- pacemaker
    - pacemaker


Note on the unsupported benchmarks
----------------------------------

### AFC (powertrain)

FalCAuN can execute the AFC model but for any requirements, it crashes due to stack overflow. This is because, in FalCAuN, `always_[11, 50]` is encoded to an LTL formulas with 50 nests of next operators, which is too large for its back-end model checker.

### AT (transmission)

FalCAuN can falsify AT1, AT2, and AT6{a,b,c}. However, AT5{1,2,3,4} are infeasible because encoding of `ev_[0.001, 0.1]` is impossible or makes the LTL formula super huge (same as AFC).

### NN (neural)

Encoding of `always_[1.0, 37.0]` makes the LTL formula too large (same as AFC). 

### WT

- WT1, WT2, WT3, WT4

### CC (Chasing Cars)

FalCAuN can falsify CC1, CC2, and CC3.
However, CC4 and CC5 are infeasible because the STL formulas are encoded to huge LTL formulas (same reason as AFC).

### F16 (f16-gcas)

FalCAuN cannot handle F16 benchmark because it is not a pure Simulink model but requires quite a lot of wrapper in MATLAB, which is currently not supported.

### sabo

FalCAuN cannot handle sabo benchmark because it is not a Simulink model but a model implemented in python. It is a future work to support such models.

How to deploy
-------------

We can deploy the scripts in this repository to the directory of ARCH-COMP.
We assume that the repository of ARCH-COMP exists at `../Codes/ARCH-COMP`.

The usage is as follows.

```sh
make -C utils/ -f Makefile.deploy
```
